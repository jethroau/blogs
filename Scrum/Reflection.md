Scrum (n): A **framework** within which people can address complex adaptive problems, 
while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.  

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or **empiricism**. 
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

**Three pillars** uphold every implementation of empirical process control: ``transparency, inspection, and adaptation.``

Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share **a common definition of “Done”.**

Scrum prescribes **four formal events** for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:
• Sprint Planning  8 hours or less
• Daily Scrum   15 minutes
• Sprint Review   4 hours or less
• Sprint Retrospective  3 hours or lesss
