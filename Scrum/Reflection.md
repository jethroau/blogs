Scrum (n): A **framework** within which people can address complex adaptive problems, 
while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.  

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or **empiricism**. 
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

**Three pillars** uphold every implementation of empirical process control: ``transparency, inspection, and adaptation.``
