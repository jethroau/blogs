Scrum (n): A **framework** within which people can address complex adaptive problems, 
while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.  

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or **empiricism**. 
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

**Three pillars** uphold every implementation of empirical process control: ``transparency, inspection, and adaptation.``

Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share **a common definition of “Done”.**

Scrum prescribes **four formal events** for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:  
• Sprint Planning  8 hours or less  
• Daily Scrum   15 minutes  
• Sprint Review   4 hours or less  
• Sprint Retrospective  3 hours or lesss   
 
When "scrum values" of **commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect** are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone.   

The Scrum Team consists of **a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.**  

Scrum Teams are **self-organizing and cross-functional.** ``Self-organizing teams`` choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. ``Cross-functional teams`` have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.  

Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. ``Incremental deliveries of “Done” `` product ensure **a potentially useful version of working product** is always available.  [not necessary to release production for each sprint]  

**The Product Owner** is responsible for ``maximizing the value of the product resulting`` from work of the Development Team.   

**The Product Owner** is the ``sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog``. Product Backlog management includes:
• Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;  
• Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;  
• Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;  
• Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,  
• Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.  
The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However,`` the Product Owner remains accountable.  ``

**The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.** The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but `those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.`  The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. `No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements. `

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of **delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint.** A _“Done”_ increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.  

* They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;  
* Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;   
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and,
* Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.
