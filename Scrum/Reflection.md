Scrum (n): A **framework** within which people can address complex adaptive problems, 
while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.  

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or **empiricism**. 
Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

**Three pillars** uphold every implementation of empirical process control: ``transparency, inspection, and adaptation.``

Those performing the work and those inspecting the resulting increment must share **a common definition of “Done”.**

Scrum prescribes **four formal events** for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:  
* Sprint Planning  8 hours or less  
* Daily Scrum   15 minutes  
* Sprint Review   4 hours or less  
* Sprint Retrospective  3 hours or lesss   
 
When "scrum values" of **commitment, courage, focus, openness and respect** are embodied and lived by the Scrum Team, the Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life and build trust for everyone.   

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated `roles, events, artifacts, and rules`. 

The Scrum Team consists of **a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.**  

Scrum Teams are **self-organizing and cross-functional.** ``Self-organizing teams`` choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. ``Cross-functional teams`` have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.  

Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. ``Incremental deliveries of “Done” `` product ensure **a potentially useful version of working product** is always available.  [not necessary to release production for each sprint]  

The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize **flexibility, creativity, and productivity**

After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, **the Scrum Team** crafts a Sprint Goal.

**The Product Owner** is responsible for ``maximizing the value of the product resulting`` from work of the Development Team.   

**The Product Owner** is the ``sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog``. Product Backlog management includes:
* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;  
* Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;  
* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;  
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,  
* Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.  
The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However,`` the Product Owner remains accountable.  ``

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for the Product Backlog. However,` he or she can delegate some work related to product backlog management to the Development Team.`

**The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.** The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but `those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.`  The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. `No one can force the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements. `

**The Development Team** consists of professionals who do the work of **delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint.** A _“Done”_ increment is required at the Sprint Review. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.  
* They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;  
* Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person;   
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations, or business analysis; and,
* Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but `accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole`.

Optimal Development Team size **(3 ~ 9 members)** is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.  

**Only members of the Development Team** create the Increment.

`The Development Team is responsible for all estimates in the Product Backlog.` The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.

**The Scrum Master** is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by ``helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. ``  

The Scrum Master is `a servant-leader` for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master `helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.`  

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. `he Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team `understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t.

**The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner** in several ways, including:
* Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domain are `understood by everyone` on the Scrum Team as well as possible;
* Finding techniques for effective `Product Backlog management`;
* `Helping the Scrum Team understand` the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
* Ensuring the Product Owner knows `how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value`;
* Understanding and ``practicing agility``; and,
* ``Facilitating Scrum events`` as requested or needed.

**The Scrum Master serves the Development Team** in several ways, including:
* `Coaching` the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
* `Helping` the Development Team to create high-value products;
* `Removing impediments` to the Development Team’s progress;
* `Facilitating Scrum events` as requested or needed; and,
* `Coaching` the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.  

**The Scrum Master serves the organization** in several ways, including:
* Leading and `coaching` the organization in its `Scrum adoption`;
* Planning `Scrum implementations` within the organization;
* Helping employees and stakeholders `understand and enact Scrum` and empirical product development;
* Causing change that `increases the productivity` of the Scrum Team; and,
* Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.  

All **Scrum events are time-boxed events**, such that every event has a maximum duration. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened.    

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, **a time-box of one month or less** during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.  Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. ``A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.``  

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.  
During the Sprint:
* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal; 
* Quality goals do not decrease; and,
* `Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team` as more is learned.

A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. **Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint**.  

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.    

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to **a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint**. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.  

**The Sprint Backlog** is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, ``plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal``.

The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is **solely up to the Development Team**. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.   

Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, **often to units of one day or less**. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.  

Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.  If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected,` they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog` within the Sprint.   

**Only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint**. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team.

The input to **sprint planing** meeting is the ``Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and past performance of the Development Team``.

**Sprint Planning** answers the following:
- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

The Daily Scrum is **a 15-minute time-boxed event** for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint.

Here is an daily scrum example of what might be used: 
* What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? 
* What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
* Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?  
The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.   

`The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting`, but `the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum`. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within **the 15-minute time-box**.  

A Sprint Review is held at **the end of the Sprint** to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, **the Scrum Team and stakeholders** collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration. `This is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. ` `The Scrum Master ensures` that `the event takes place` and that attendees understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches everyone involved to `keep it within the time-box.`  

**The result of the Sprint Review** is `a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint`. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.  

The **Sprint Retrospective** is an opportunity for the `Scrum Team to inspect itself` and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.  `The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.`  This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.  `The Scrum Master participates as a peer team member` in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process.

the **Sprint Retrospective** provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation. 

The purpose of the **Sprint Retrospective** is to:
1. Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools;
2. Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements; and,
3. Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

During each Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team plans ways to `increase product quality by improving work processes or adapting the definition of “Done”`, if appropriate and not in conflict with product or organizational standards.

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is **the single source of requirements** for any changes to be made to the product. `The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog`, including its content, availability, and ordering.  

A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initially known and best-understood requirements. If a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.  

Product Backlog items often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when “Done.”   

Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. **One Product Backlog is used to describe** the upcoming work on the product.  

Product Backlog refinement usually consumes no more than **10%** of the capacity of the Development Team.

Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail.  

The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.  

An increment is a body of inspectable, done work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint. The increment is a step toward a vision or goal. The increment must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it.  

The Scrum Master’s job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts.   

The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of **potentially releasable functionality** that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of “Done.”   

If there are multiple Scrum Teams working on the system or product release, the Development Teams on `all the Scrum Teams must mutually define the definition of “Done.”`
